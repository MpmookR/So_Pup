SoPup is a SwiftUI-based iOS application designed to support responsible dog socialisation, adapting the experience based on the dog’s age.

The app operates in two distinct modes:
- **Puppy Mode** (0–12 weeks): education, safety, and controlled exposure
- **Social Mode** (12+ weeks): matchmaking, chat, meet-ups, and reviews
