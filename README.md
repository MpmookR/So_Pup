# 🐶 SoPup: Dog Socialisation iOS App (MSc Final Project)

SoPup is a SwiftUI-based iOS application designed to support responsible dog socialisation, adapting the experience based on the dog’s age.

The app operates in two distinct modes:
**Puppy Mode** (0–12 weeks): education, safety, and controlled exposure
**Social Mode** (12+ weeks): matchmaking, chat, meet-ups, and reviews

This project was developed as part of an **MSc in Software Engineering** and focuses on **clean iOS architecture, real-time systems, and scalable backend design.**
